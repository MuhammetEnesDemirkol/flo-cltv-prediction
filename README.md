# 📈 FLO - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses solely on predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** using real customer transaction data from FLO.
The analysis applies **BG/NBD** and **Gamma-Gamma** probabilistic models to forecast both customer purchasing behavior and their expected monetary contributions.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Preprocess and clean customer data.
- Handle outliers and perform feature engineering.
- Estimate 3-month and 6-month purchase frequencies with the **BG/NBD model**.
- Predict average transaction value using the **Gamma-Gamma model**.
- Calculate 6-month CLTV scores.
- Segment customers based on CLTV results.
- Develop marketing strategies focused on high-value customers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Lifetimes (BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma Modeling)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
